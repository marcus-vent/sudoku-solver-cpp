# sudoku-solver-cpp
To compile and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler.

1. Prerequisites:
The project files: sudoku_solver.cpp and puzzle.txt.

2. The program will start and display the main menu.

The program loads puzzles from a puzzle.txt file, which must be in the same directory as the executable. The format is a simple 9x9 grid of numbers:
Each row of the Sudoku puzzle should be on a new line.
The numbers in each row should be separated by a single space.
Use the number 0 to represent an empty or unsolved cell.
